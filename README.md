# Reddit_NLP

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to pull comment data from political subreddits that are either biased to the 'Left' or the 'Right', and from those comments train a model to understand the linquistic differences between comments made on subreddits on opposite ends of the political spectrum.

**Model Use Case**
Sites like Reddit often times employ censorship (usually for filtering out heinous posts), but specific subreddits may have rules for allowable comments. If a forum-based company, like Reddit, wanted to censor opposing opinions from a political forum, the company could employ a model such as the one worked on in this project. A model like this one may also suit an authoritarian government, but hopefully that doesn't happen...I do enjoy speaking freely.
